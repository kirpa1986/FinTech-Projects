Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. The application integrates the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency. For testing purposes it uses the local blockchain and Ganache to create the new Ethereum account instance and test the functionality (creating, estimating, signing and finally sending the transaction)

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies (some of them can already be installed for your environment).

```python
  pip install streamlit
```

You should also download and install the latest version of Ganache. Follow the instructions on the [**Ganache download page**](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) to download and install this tool on your local machine.

To start your local blockchain you simply pick a Quickstart option in Ganache. For testing purposes you can use the mnemonic phrase generated for your workspace that you can save for further testing. 

**Note**: Closing Ganache and running it again will cause an initiation of fully new local blockchain with new mnemonic phrase and test accounts. 

To be able to create and track a test account in Ganach the mnemonic phraase should be added to .env file:
```python
  MNEMONIC = 'Your Mnemonic Phrase'
```

For testing purposes this application doesn't have any real connections to DB, instead it has the hard-coded DB with random records (candidates).

Additionally the application is using [**Alpha Vantage API**](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to retrieve the current Ether price and calculate the USD equivalents of the numbers presented in Ether (wages). To use this functionality you should get your free API key and add it to .env file:
```python
  ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY='Your AV Key'
```
