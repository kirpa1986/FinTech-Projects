![user_interface](./static/pychain_ledger.png)

On the left side (in sidebar) you can configure the level of difficulty needed to generate a new block, plus you can add a new block to the PyChain Ledger specifying transaction details in the corresponding fields.

On the right side you can review PyChain Ledger with all added blocks, you can validate your PyChain Ledger and you can inspect any block by selecting it in the dropdown field with the block info.
