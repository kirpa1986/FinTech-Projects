# Financial Planning Tools

This projects aims to anaalyze a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. Each stock has its own table in the local etf.db database, which is located in the project folder.
Analysis includes daily returns calculation of the ETF stocks both individually and as a whole. Prepared in the notebook visualizations will be deployed to a web application by using the Voila library.

## Technologies

This analysis is prepared in Jupyter Notebook using python 3.8 and the rich features of the [**pandas library**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to perform the data analysis. 

[**sqlalchemy**](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is an open-source SQL library for Python. It’s designed to ease the communication between Python-based programs and databases.

With [**Voilà**](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a Python library, you can convert a Jupyter notebook into a live webpage.


## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies (some of them can already be installed for your environment).

```python
pip install SQLAlchemy
conda install -c conda-forge voila
```

## Usage

To use the ETF Analyzer project simply clone the repository and open the **etf_analyzer.ipynb** file in Jupyter Notebook. 

Voilà accepts a path to the notebook and then generates a web app with any visualizations or output that were generated in the Jupyter notebook. The code to run is:
```python
voila <relative-path-to-notebook>
```
Here is an example of one of the visualizations generated by the project's notebook and displayed on the web-page using Voila library r=that starts a local web-server (*localhost:port*):
